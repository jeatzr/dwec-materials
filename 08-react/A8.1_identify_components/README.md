# **EJ_8.1 Atomic Design Web Application Analysis Practice**

## **Objective:**
The goal of this practice is to analyze a web application by identifying its components according to the principles of Atomic Design. This exercise will help students understand how web interfaces are structured and how to break down a UI into smaller, reusable parts.

---

## **Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Select a Web Application**
Choose any web application from the internet (e.g., e-commerce sites, social media platforms, productivity tools). Ensure the application has a variety of UI components to analyze.

### **Step 2: Identify Atomic Design Components**
Use the Atomic Design methodology to classify the components you see in the web application. Atomic Design is composed of the following five levels:

1. **Atoms:**
   - The basic building blocks of the UI, such as buttons, input fields, icons, etc.
   - Example: A search input field or a logo.

2. **Molecules:**
   - Groups of atoms that work together as a unit.
   - Example: A search bar composed of an input field, a button, and an icon.

3. **Organisms:**
   - Complex components formed by a combination of molecules and/or atoms.
   - Example: A website header with a logo, navigation menu, and search bar.

4. **Templates:**
   - Page-level structures that arrange organisms into a layout.
   - Example: A product page layout that includes a header, product list, and footer.

5. **Pages:**
   - Fully designed pages that represent the final UI.
   - Example: The home page or the login page of the application.

### **Step 3: Document Your Analysis**
For each component you identify, document the following:

| Component Level | Description | Screenshot/Example |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Atom            | Description of the atom and where it is used in the app | Insert screenshot or link |
| Molecule        | Description of the molecule and its role | Insert screenshot or link |
| Organism        | Description of the organism and its structure | Insert screenshot or link |
| Template        | Description of the template and how it organizes content | Insert screenshot or link |
| Page            | Description of the page and its purpose | Insert screenshot or link |

### **Step 4: Submit Your Work**
- Prepare your analysis as a report in PDF format.
- Include screenshots or links to the specific components analyzed.
- Submit your report to the instructor by the due date.

## **Assessment Criteria:**
Your work will be assessed based on the following:

| Criteria          | Points |
|-------------------|--------|
| Accuracy of component identification | 20     |
| Clarity of descriptions               | 20     |
| Use of screenshots/examples           | 20     |
| Completeness of the analysis          | 20     |
| Overall presentation                  | 20     |
| **Total**                             | **100** |
